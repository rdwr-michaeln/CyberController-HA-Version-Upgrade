## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdwr-michaeln/CyberController-HA-Version-Upgrade.git
cd CyberController-HA-Version-Upgrade
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìñ Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Step 1: Pre-Upgrade Preparation

#### System Requirements Check
```bash
# Check available memory (need ~2GB+ for large files)
free -h

# Check available disk space (need ~20% of upgrade file size)
df -h .

# Verify Python version
python3 --version
```

#### Network Connectivity Test
```bash
# Test connectivity to both controllers
ping <primary-controller-ip>
ping <secondary-controller-ip>

# Test HTTPS access
curl -k https://<primary-controller-ip>/mgmt/system/status
curl -k https://<secondary-controller-ip>/mgmt/system/status
```

### Step 2: Pre-Upload Validation (Recommended)

**For large upgrade files (>5GB), always run validation first:**
```bash
python validate_upload.py
```

This utility will check:
- ‚úÖ File existence and readability
- ‚úÖ Available system memory and disk space
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity to controllers
- ‚úÖ Authentication credentials
- ‚úÖ Estimated upload time

### Step 3: Run the Main Upgrade

#### First Time / Fresh Start
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Resume from Interruption
If the script was interrupted, it will automatically detect the checkpoint:
```bash
python main.py
# When prompted: "Do you want to start fresh? (y/n):"
# Choose 'n' to resume from last checkpoint
```

### Step 4: Input Required Information

The script will prompt you for the following information in order:

#### Primary Controller Configuration
```
Primary CyberController address: 192.168.1.100
Primary username: admin
Primary password: ********
```

#### Secondary Controller Configuration
```
Secondary CyberController address: 192.168.1.101
Secondary username: admin
Secondary password: ********
```

#### Upgrade File Details
```
Upgrade file path (.tar.gz): /path/to/upgrade-file.tar.gz
```

**File Size Warning**: For files >5GB, you'll see a warning about expected upload time and can choose to continue or cancel.

### Step 5: Monitor Progress

The script provides real-time feedback:
